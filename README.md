# Combination Generator

## What It Does
The Combination Generator is a cli python program that allows the user to create a list of possible combinations based on the possible numbers that can be used and the amount of numbers that are in the combination.
## Why It Was Created
A friend of mine, who is a LED stunt saber fitness instructor for (Sabercraft)[https://sabercraft.org], asked me if it'd be possible generate a list of every possible combination of saber strikes for a set amount of strikes. He wanted my help in this to prove a very funny point.

## Roadmap of Planned Features
* Create first working version that saves output to text file
* Allow the user to denote if it's all combinations of set amount of numbers or if it's all combinations up to a set amount of numbers (i.e. x^c or x^a+x^b+x^c)
* Allow the user to denote if numbers are non-repeating in the combinations
* Export output to a SQL/SQLite database
* Pull combinations that already generated (From SQl/SQLite database)
* Allow single combination generation
* Port to web app
